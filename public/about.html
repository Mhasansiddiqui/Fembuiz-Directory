                                            <p>Recently, media personality, Mia Freedman posted a Facebook status update highlighting
                                                just how unsafe women can feel at times. She arrived home and there was a
                                                man on her roof. She wasn’t sure who he was. She didn’t know if he was a
                                                burglar, or what was going on. She called her husband and he told her that
                                                he was the tradie. Following this, Freedman reflected that women shouldn’t
                                                need to feel like they’re in danger.</p>
                                            <p>Well, to go some way to addressing this issue, Fembuiz Directory was set up to
                                                solve that very problem. It’s not a charity. It’s a directory that enables
                                                women, or anyone for that matter, to search for female tradies to sort out
                                                their home repairs or anything else that they need doing. There’s no need
                                                to feel unsafe, and there’s no risk that you’re calling on a tradie who may
                                                become violent.</p>

                                            <p>1 – To help women feel safer in their communities.</p>
                                            <p>2 – To enable female business owners and tradies to list their services.</p>
                                            <p>As a business, our mission statement is to empower women to enter the trades
                                                or other and go into business. We want to help close the pay gap between
                                                men and women. The best way to do that is for women who are currently in
                                                the trades, to connect with other women, and for women to know that there
                                                are actually women in the trades.</p>
                                            <p>All it takes is one person to spread the word and who knows what will happen?
                                                You may be calling a tradie today, but your daughter may become one the next
                                                day, or when she grows up. So, take a look around, and you’ll find the tradies
                                                that you never knew existed. For years it’s seemed like women don’t enter
                                                the trades, and if you’re a female tradie, it can be tough to gain business
                                                due to the lack of knowledge of your existence.</p>
